A small form where we can enter films that we have seen and give them a rating and delete it if we want. 

The website have the following functions:

. Users should be able to add a movie by entering a title and a rating.
. Validate that both the title and rating entered by the user have been entered before a  film can be saved. Feedback takes place through pop-up boxes.
. The form is reset after a movie is added.
. A film in the list must be represented by title (text) and stars.
